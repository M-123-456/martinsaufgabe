            Johannes Vermeer (/vɜːrˈmɪər, vɜːrˈmɛər/ fur-MEER, fur-MAIR, Dutch:
            [fərˈmeːr], see below; October 1632 – December 1675) was a Dutch Baroque
            Period[3] painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of
            middle-class life. During his lifetime, he was a moderately successful
            provincial genre painter, recognized in Delft and The Hague. Nonetheless,
            he produced relatively few paintings and evidently was not wealthy,
            leaving his wife and children in debt at his death.[4] Vermeer worked
            slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments.
            He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in
            his work.

        Relatively little was known about Vermeer's life until recently.[13] He
        seems to have been devoted exclusively to his art, living out his life in
        the city of Delft. Until the 19th century, the only sources of information
        were some registers, a few official documents, and comments by other
        artists; for this reason, Thoré-Bürger named him "The Sphinx of
        Delft".[14] John Michael Montias added details on the family from the city
        archives of Delft in his Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic
        Study of the Seventeenth Century (1982).

        Johannes Vermeer was baptized within the Reformed Church on 31 October
        1632.[15][16][a] His mother, Digna Baltens (c. 1596 –
        1670[20][21][22]),[b] was from Antwerp.[23][24][25][18][22] Digna's
        father, Balthasar Geerts,[21] or Gerrits,[22] (born in Antwerp in or
        around 1573)[21] led an enterprising life, and was arrested for
        counterfeiting.[21][18] Vermeer's father, named Reijnier Janszoon, was a
        middle-class worker of silk or caffa (a mixture of silk and cotton or
        wool).[Note 1] He was the son of Jan Reyersz and Cornelia (Neeltge)
        Goris.[c] As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable
        Sint Antoniesbreestraat, a street with many resident painters at the time.
        In 1615, Reijnier married Digna. The couple moved to Delft and had a
        daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620.[Note 2] In 1625, Reijnier
        was involved in a fight with a soldier named Willem van Bylandt who died
        from his wounds five months later.[27] Around this time, Reijnier began
        dealing in paintings. In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called "The
        Flying Fox". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he
        bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town
        "Mechelen". The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable
        financial burden.[Huerta 1] When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer
        took over the operation of the family's art business.
